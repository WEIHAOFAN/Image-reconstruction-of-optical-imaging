The scripts aim to reconstruct the brain functions in diffuse optical tomography.
The scripts requires the software package "NIRFASTer and "NeuroDOT" to generate the sensitivity matrix based on diffusion approximation (see Weihao Fan, et al, Neurophotonics, 2021)
Another option to generate sensitivity matrix is using the Monte Carlo simulation which are also provided, where the software MMC or MCX Space are required
